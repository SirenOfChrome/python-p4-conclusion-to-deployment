# Conclusion to Deployment

## Learning Goals

- Understand what "deploying" means.
- Understand the responsibilities of a web server.
- Evaluate platforms for deploying Flask applications.
- Set up your local environment for deploying with Render.
- Deploy a basic Flask application to Render.
- Deploy a full-stack Flask-React application to Render.

## Key Vocab

- **Deployment**: the processes that make an application available for its
  intended use. For web applications, this means moving the application to a
  platform that supports requests from the internet.
- **Developer Operations (DevOps)**: the practices and tools that improve a
  team's ability to develop and deploy applications quickly.
- **PostgreSQL**: an open-source relational database system that provides more
  SQL functionality than SQLite. Unlike SQLite, its data is stored on a server
  rather than in files.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: a development and deployment platform that
  exists on a wide range of servers with different functionality. PaaS solutions
  reduce maintenance time for a software development team, but can increase
  cost. Some PaaS solutions, such as Render, provide free tiers for small
  applications.

## Conclusion

In the previous module, you learned how to use the skills you've developed at
Flatiron to build robust, full-stack applications. This module challenged you
to learn an important process to allow you to show off your skills to the world:
**deployment**.

In this module, you:

- Learned about Platforms as a Service and the many PaaS options available to
  you in your personal and professional development.
- Began using PostgreSQL, a server-based database solution.
- Deployed a RESTful Flask API to Render.
- Deployed a full-stack Flask-React Application to Render.

These are the last lessons of your Flatiron education- congratulations on making
it this far! Up next, you will put your skills from Phase 4 to the test in the
Phase 4 Code Challenge.
